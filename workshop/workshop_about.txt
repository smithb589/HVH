Version 1.7.1

[b]WHAT'S NEW WITH 1.7.1?[/b]
This patch overhauls the paradropping feature and adds a new set of constraints surrounding disconnected players. Basically:
- You still have control over disconnected heroes.
- Killing DC'd players doesn't give you a point anymore.
- DC'd Snipers take longer to respawn.
- Night Stalker respawns faster.
- Depending on how low the Sniper player count drops, Night Stalker first loses his Phase Boots, and then his inventory becomes clogged with bananas. This makes it harder for NS to run away, and he can't pick up as many items as before. See the Update Notes for more information.

[b]HUNTER v HUNTED[/b] is a fast-paced 4v1 PVP mode that pits teamwork against terror. The balance of power is constantly shifting, requiring players to play offensively one minute and defensively the next. On one team, the four Snipers must watch each other's backs and follow the nose of their trusty Hound. On the other team, the solo Night Stalker must learn to divide and conquer by staging ambushes and cleverly evading capture. This game mode includes a tailored map, custom abilities, AI companions, items that grant Dota 2 abilities, and more. It is designed to be fun with groups of varying skill levels.

[b]OBJECTIVE:[/b]
Each team has limited lives. Kill the other team before they kill you! Games should last 15-25 minutes.
