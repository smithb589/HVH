1.7.1
----
QUALITY OF LIFE
-- Updated paradropping effects and behavior (Gyro!)
-- Snipers no longer begin the game paradropping, but respawns continue to paradrop
-- Fix for wisp tether not breaking
-- New sfx/particles for Houndmaster ability
-- Night Stalker's respawn speed is halved
-- Miscellaneous fixes
LOW PLAYER COUNT RE-BALANCE
-- When a disconnected character is killed, their team no longer loses a point.
-- When a disconnected Sniper dies, their respawn timer is tripled.
-- When the game begins with fewer than 4 Snipers, or Sniper players disconnect during gameplay, the Night Stalker's inventory will be handicapped to make for a more balanced game experience. Items will be dropped to make room for bananas, if necessary. A banana does nothing and cannot be dropped until the Sniper reconnects. The Night Stalker's inventory will be affected in the following ways:
---- 4 Snipers: Phase boots
---- 3 Snipers: Boots of speed
---- 2 Snipers: No boots, 3 bananas
---- 1 Sniper: No boots, 5 bananas

MEET THE SNIPERS
-- Snipers are given a 5th blank ability (hot-key D). If you last-hit the Night Stalker, you can choose 1 of 4 new abilities to fill that slot, each based on the personalities of the Sniper family clan. Once picked, the ability cannot be picked by anyone else. If the same player kills NS twice, or if the Hound gets the last hit, a random ally gets to choose a new ability instead. However, if the Night Stalker denies himself or dies to neutral creeps, nobody gets it!
