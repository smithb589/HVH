MEET THE SNIPERS
-- Snipers are given a 5th blank ability (hot-key D). If you last-hit the Night Stalker, you can choose 1 of 4 new abilities to fill that slot, each based on the personalities of the Sniper family clan. Once picked, the ability cannot be picked by anyone else. If the same player kills NS twice, or if the Hound gets the last hit, a random ally gets to choose a new ability instead. However, if the Night Stalker denies himself or dies to neutral creeps, nobody gets it!
-- Kardel: Bonus attack range passive; creates item_assassinates on long cooldown.

-- Florax: Global self-teleport.
